                            Parcels are an Australian electropop five-piece
                            formed in Byron Bay, Australia, in 2014. Today they
                            are based in Berlin, Germany. The band's line-up is
                            composed of keyboardist Louie Swain,
                            keyboardist/guitarist Patrick Hetherington, bassist
                            Noah Hill, drummer Anatole "Toto" Serret, and
                            guitarist Jules Crommelin.

                            Signed to French label Kitsun√©, the band rose to
                            prominence after collaborating with the electronic
                            duo Daft Punk on the production and writing of their
                            2017 single "Overnight"

                            In 2018 Parcels released their self-titled debut
                            record with singles "Tieduprightnow", "Bemyself",
                            "Lightenup" and "Withorwithout". Parcels describe
                            themselves as "sort of a blend between electro-pop
                            and disco-soul".

                            In their final year of high school in 2014, the five
                            boys, Swain, Hetherington, Hill, Serret and
                            Crommelin, formed as Parcels. The story behind the
                            name 'Parcels' differs from source to source.
                            Consistently, the members report having taken the
                            name from an old train sign that resided at Swain's
                            parent's house. In one interview the sign is said to
                            be seen in Swain's parent's pastry caf√®. Another
                            says that Swain stole the sign from their local
                            train station and hung it in his basement.
